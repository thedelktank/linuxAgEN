<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>A resume for Trevor Delker</h2>

<p>I guess this is where I would start to go into the nitty, gritty details about my experience in various technologies and coding languages. But, there's only so much you can do with words. 
    That is why I thought it would be a lot more fun for any hiring manager, or HR professional, to view this instead of a stand resume. This may be supplemental, or primary. Just have fun!
